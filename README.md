# Pennsylvania Political Realignment Map (2000-2024)

An interactive web-based visualization exploring Pennsylvania's transformation from a reliably Democratic state to America's most critical swing state. This project analyzes 24 years of election data across all 67 Pennsylvania counties, tracking how voting patterns have shifted and what these changes mean for presidential politics.

## 🗺️ Overview

Pennsylvania has undergone a dramatic political realignment over the past two decades. This visualization provides an interactive framework to explore that transformation at the county level, revealing:

- **Working-class realignment**: Counties like Lackawanna (Biden's hometown) and Luzerne flipped from Democratic strongholds to Republican leans
- **Suburban shifts**: Philadelphia collar counties (Montgomery, Delaware, Chester, Bucks) transformed from Republican to Democratic
- **Urban Democratic firewall**: Philadelphia and Allegheny (Pittsburgh) counties generate 500,000+ Democratic votes, but face overwhelming Republican margins in rural PA
- **The 2024 result**: Trump won Pennsylvania 50.50% to 48.70%, reestablishing Republican presidential dominance

## 📊 Features

- **Interactive Mapbox visualization** showing county-level election results with color-coded competitiveness categories
- **Contest selector** to compare results across presidential, Senate, gubernatorial, and other statewide races
- **Statewide temperature bar** displaying aggregate margins and vote production
- **County profiles** providing historical context and demographic analysis
- **Completeness**: 2000-2024 data across all 67 Pennsylvania counties

### Political Categories

Results are categorized by margin of victory:

- **Annihilation** (40%+): Overwhelming one-party dominance
- **Dominant** (30-39.99%): Strong one-party state
- **Stronghold** (20-29.99%): Likely one-party
- **Safe** (10-19.99%): Probable one-party
- **Likely** (5.50-9.99%): Lean toward one party
- **Lean** (1-5.49%): Slight preference for one party
- **Tilt** (0.50-0.99%): Minimal margin
- **Tossup** (<0.50%): Essentially tied

## 📈 Key Findings

### Lackawanna County: Biden's Hometown and the Working-Class Realignment
Joe Biden's childhood home in Scranton (Lackawanna County) exemplifies the working-class realignment:
- 2008: D+25.99% (Obama's peak in this labor county)
- 2016: D+3.48% (Trump: R+22.60% swing in one cycle)
- 2020: D+8.37% (Biden recovers his hometown coalition)
- 2024: D+2.79% (Harris: barely holds on, margins too narrow to save Senate races)

**The story**: Lackawanna swung 22.6 points toward Trump in 2016—one of the largest single-cycle swings in the state. Biden partially recovered the county in 2020, but the gains were insufficient. The working-class defection from Democratic candidates was so severe that it flipped neighboring Luzerne County to Trump and narrowly lost Senate races in 2024 despite Harris's narrow margin in Lackawanna itself.


### Philadelphia: Democratic Firewall
Philadelphia County (1.6M residents) is Democrats' most valuable asset:
- Delivers 400,000+ Democratic vote margins
- Voting 75-85% Democratic across expanding urban professional base
- Growing Democratic margins each cycle (D+33% in 2016 → D+40% in 2024)

### Bob Casey's Historic Defeat: The Working-Class Realignment Goes National

Senator Bob Casey Jr.'s 2024 loss to Republican Dave McCormick represents the culmination of the working-class realignment that has reshaped Pennsylvania politics since 2016.

#### The Numbers

**2018 (Casey's safe re-election) vs. 2024 (Casey's historic defeat):**
- **Luzerne County** (anthracite, working-class): Casey won D+7.00% in 2018 → Lost R+18.00% in 2024 (-25.00% swing)
- **Lackawanna County** (Biden's hometown): Casey won D+10%+ in 2018 → Won by only D+2.80% in 2024 (swing of -7-8%)
- **Beaver County** (steel country): Already flipped Republican but margins expanded further R+21%
- **Greene County** (coal): Decisively Republican R+45.70%

#### Why Casey Lost Despite Winning Philadelphia

McCormick won by just R+0.22% (48.82%-48.60%, 15,115 votes), the tightest Senate race. Casey's math failed because:

1. **Urban gains insufficient**: Philadelphia margins grew D+40%+, adding ~50,000 votes for Democrats
2. **Suburban slippage**: Bucks County, once a Republican stronghold, went Democratic but not by enough; Montgomery County's shift smaller than 2022
3. **Rural/working-class avalanche**: In 60+ rural/exurban counties, Republicans ran up historic margins (60-75%), offsetting Philadelphia
4. **The Luzerne catastrophe**: Losing Luzerne by 18% in a Senate race was unprecedented; the county represents Pennsylvania's union, working-class Democratic base

#### What Made 2024 Different

Casey had survived the 2016 Trump wave, winning re-election in 2018 during a midterm. But 2024 was different:

- **Turnout failure**: Democrats didn't mobilize their urban base like they had in 2020
- **Working-class rejection**: Harris's campaign failed to connect with non-college voters; McCormick, a wealthy businessman, positioned himself as an outsider
- **Abortion localization failed**: Casey's pro-labor, anti-abortion positioning couldn't overcome economic messaging in working-class regions
- **The incumbent penalty**: After Biden's unpopular tenure and Harris's last-minute candidacy, anti-incumbent sentiment hurt Casey
- **Congressional coattails**: Voters who picked Trump for president also picked Republicans in Senate races (less ticket-splitting than 2020)

#### Luzerne County: The Bellwether of Working-Class Flight

Luzerne exemplifies the Democratic collapse among working-class voters:

| Election | Dem Candidate | Republican | Margin |
|----------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **2008** | Obama | McCain | D+8.41% |
| **2012** | Obama | Romney | D+4.81% |
| **2016** | Clinton | Trump | R+19.44% (18-point swing) |
| **2020** | Biden | Trump | R+14.39% (Trump consolidation) |
| **2022** | Shapiro (Gov) | Mastriano | D+2.00% (Mastriano too extreme) |
| **2024** | Harris (Pres) | Trump | R+19.17% (consolidated Trump support) |
| **2024** | Casey (Senate) | McCormick | R+18.00% (strongest Republican performance) |

**The pattern**: Once Democrats win a Luzerne-type county (coal/steel/union), they assume the math still holds. But the 2016 realignment was permanent. There's no route back for Democrats until the party rebuilds trust in working-class regions or the working-class coalition shifts again.

#### The Larger Meaning: Pennsylvania's New Politics

Casey's loss shows that Pennsylvania's working-class realignment is now complete and locked in place:

- **Republicans control rural Pennsylvania** (60+ counties) with expanding margins
- **Democrats control urban Pennsylvania** (Philadelphia + Allegheny) with growing margins  
- **Suburbs remain battlegrounds** but not enough to save Democrats when rural margins explode

A future Democratic candidate for Senate would need:
1. Philadelphia: ~500,000 Democratic votes (growing, achievable)
2. Suburbs: Solid 3-5% margins in Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, Chester
3. **One major county flip back**: Either Luzerne or another anthracite/steel county must return to Democratic lean
4. **Turnout in swing counties**: Close margins in Dauphin, Lancaster, Erie, Centre

Without all four, Republicans will dominate Senate elections in Pennsylvania.

**Bob Casey's defeat (R+0.22%, 48.82%-48.60%, McCormick 3,399,295 vs Casey 3,384,180) was the tightest Senate race, showing how razor-thin the Republican advantage was—but the working-class realignment made it insurmountable for a lifetime incumbent who had always held labor support.**


### Northampton, Berks, and Beaver: The Geography of Senate Defeat

Bob Casey's defeat across Pennsylvania's working-class and swing counties reveals a consistent pattern: even in counties where he had previously won, Casey collapsed in 2024. Three counties—Northampton, Berks, and Beaver—showcase the scale of his losses.

#### County-by-County Senate Margin Collapse

**Northampton County (Allentown metro, working-class swing county):**

Senate Results (Casey's margins):
- 2000: Rick Santorum (R) vs Ron Klink (D): R+11.20%
- 2006: Rick Santorum (R) vs Bob Casey (D): D+16.60%
- 2010: Pat Toomey (R) vs Joe Sestak (D): R+4.60%
- 2012: Tom Smith (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+9.60%
- 2016: Patrick J. Toomey (R) vs Katie McGinty (D): R+5.90%
- 2018: Lou Barletta (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+10.60%
- 2022: Mehmet Oz (R) vs John Fetterman (D): D+5.30%
- 2024: Dave McCormick (R) vs Robert P. Casey Jr. (D): R+0.60%

Presidential (shows swing county volatility):
- 2000: D+5.50%
- 2004: D+0.88%
- 2008: D+12.14%
- 2012: D+4.58%
- 2016: R+4.17%
- 2020: D+0.54%
- 2024: R+1.77%

**Story**: Northampton is a true swing county—margins shift 5-15 points cycle to cycle based on who's running. Casey had held margins here in 2018, but 2024 saw rejection of both the Democratic presidential ticket (Harris) and Casey himself. The county's volatility reflects its composition: white working-class voters, Latino population centers (Allentown), college-educated professionals in lehigh Valley, all competing for control.

---

**Berks County (Reading metro, fast-growing, diverse, Latino stronghold):**

Senate Results (Casey's margins):
- 2000: Rick Santorum (R) vs Ron Klink (D): R+23.00%
- 2006: Rick Santorum (R) vs Bob Casey (D): D+9.50%
- 2010: Pat Toomey (R) vs Joe Sestak (D): R+11.20%
- 2012: Tom Smith (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+3.50%
- 2016: Patrick J. Toomey (R) vs Katie McGinty (D): R+10.70%
- 2018: Lou Barletta (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+3.90%
- 2022: Mehmet Oz (R) vs John Fetterman (D): R+4.50%
- 2024: Dave McCormick (R) vs Robert P. Casey Jr. (D): R+9.60%

Presidential (diverse, sensitive to economy/immigration):
- 2000: R+8.97%
- 2004: R+6.57%
- 2008: D+9.19%
- 2012: R+0.99%
- 2016: R+9.94%
- 2020: R+8.19%
- 2024: R+12.18%

**Story**: Berks is Pennsylvania's fastest-growing county, with a booming Latino population (20%+). It should be Democratic territory—diverse, young, growing. Instead, Casey's margins collapsed. This reveals a critical 2024 reality: Latino voters, especially working-class and non-college Latino voters, abandoned Democrats for Trump. The Harris campaign's late entry and McCormick's messaging on the economy appealed to Latino men in particular.

---

**Beaver County (Pittsburgh steel country, heavily Republican):**

Senate Results (Casey's margins):
- 2000: Rick Santorum (R) vs Ron Klink (D): D+10.40%
- 2006: Rick Santorum (R) vs Bob Casey (D): D+24.10%
- 2010: Pat Toomey (R) vs Joe Sestak (D): R+4.90%
- 2012: Tom Smith (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+2.40%
- 2016: Patrick J. Toomey (R) vs Katie McGinty (D): R+12.40%
- 2018: Lou Barletta (R) vs Bob Casey Jr. (D): D+3.80%
- 2022: Mehmet Oz (R) vs John Fetterman (D): R+8.50%
- 2024: Dave McCormick (R) vs Robert P. Casey Jr. (D): R+16.40%

Presidential (steel country realigned Republican):
- 2000: D+8.74%
- 2004: D+2.70%
- 2008: R+2.84%
- 2012: R+6.57%
- 2016: R+18.71%
- 2020: R+17.68%
- 2024: R+20.71%

**Story**: Beaver County represents the complete working-class realignment. Once Democratic (union steel mills), it now votes 60%+ Republican. Casey's margins here collapsed from being somewhat competitive in 2018 to decisively Republican in 2024. 

The particularly sharp Republican swing in 2024 (R+20.71%, up from R+17.68% in 2020) was likely influenced by the **East Palestine train derailment disaster** in February 2023. The Norfolk Southern derailment occurred in Columbiana County, Ohio—directly across the state line from Beaver County. The toxic chemical spill and subsequent controlled burn of vinyl chloride created widespread environmental and health concerns. The Biden administration's response was widely criticized as slow and insufficient, with perception that the federal government prioritized other issues over working-class communities facing an environmental crisis. For Beaver County voters—already skeptical of Democrats on energy and environmental policies—the East Palestine response reinforced narratives of Democratic indifference to blue-collar concerns. This is the "bellwether of the realignment"—if Casey can't win Beaver, he can't win statewide.

#### Comparing McCormick to Barletta: Two Different Outsiders

Dave McCormick's 2024 victory over Bob Casey was the culmination of what Lou Barletta's 2018 campaign against Casey attempted but failed. Both were wealthy businessmen outsiders, but their contexts—and outcomes—were fundamentally different.

**Lou Barletta (2018): The Builder Who Lost by Double Digits**

Barletta was Mayor of Hazleton, a small city in working-class Luzerne County known for his hardline immigration stance. He challenged Casey in 2018:

- **Barletta's profile**: Anti-immigration, pro-Trump surrogate, populist appeal, working-class roots
- **The environment**: Trump's 2016 victory had energized Republicans, but 2018 was a midterm backlash year against Trump
- **Barletta's statewide decimation**: Lost to Casey by **D+13.35% statewide** (13-point shellacking to a three-term incumbent)
- **County-level victories** (barely won only 3 counties):
  - Greene County (SW PA): Narrow win
  - Fulton County (SW PA): Narrow win
  - Forest County (NW PA): Narrow win
- **County-level losses in working-class strongholds**:
  - Luzerne (Barletta's own county): Lost by D+7.00% despite being his home base
  - Beaver: Lost by D+2-3% in steel country
  - Northampton: Lost in swing county
  - Berks: Lost in diverse county

**Why Barletta failed**: 2018 was a Democratic midterm wave. Voters were tired of Trump, and Barletta was too closely identified with Trump. Working-class voters who supported Trump in 2016 weren't yet ready to make it permanent across the board—they still voted Democratic in statewide races. Barletta's narrow victories in only 3 rural PA counties showed the limits of Trump-focused populism in a midterm backlash.

---

**Dave McCormick (2024): The Tech Billionaire Who Won**

McCormick was a hedge fund manager, Gulf War veteran, and outsider to elected politics. He challenged Casey in 2024:

- **McCormick's profile**: Wealthy but not flamboyant, veteran, anti-China hawk, economic populist messaging, no political past
- **The environment**: Biden's unpopular presidency, Harris's last-minute candidacy, economic backlash, working-class realignment complete and locked in
- **McCormick's Senate margins**: Won by just R+0.22% (48.82%-48.60%, 15,115 votes) statewide (tightest race)
- **County-level results**:
  - Luzerne (Barletta's base): Won for McCormick by 18+ points
  - Beaver: Won decisively (R+20%+)
  - Northampton: Won (swing county tipped)
  - Berks: Won or nearly tied (massive improvement over 2018)

#### What Changed Between Barletta and McCormick

| Factor | Barletta 2018 | McCormick 2024 |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Economic message** | Pro-Trump rallies, anti-immigrant | Anti-China economic populism, tariff strategy |
| **Working-class appeal** | Immigration-focused | Cost of living, jobs, manufacturing |
| **Incumbent strength** | Casey trusted in working-class | Casey post-Biden economic failures |
| **Turnout dynamics** | Midterm backlash vs Trump | Presidential year coattails, Republican energy |
| **Campaign sophistication** | Local populist | Nationally-funded, polished |
| **Trump factor** | Barletta as Trump lite | McCormick independent, Trump as co-draw |
| **Key counties** | Lost Luzerne D+7% | Won Luzerne R+18% |
| **Statewide result** | Lost D+13.35% | Won R+0.22% (48.82%-48.60%) |

---

#### The Three Counties as Bellwethers

These three counties reveal why McCormick succeeded where Barletta failed:

1. **Northampton (swing county)**: Barletta couldn't win it. McCormick did. The difference: voters needed 6 more years of working-class realignment to solidify, plus Harris couldn't mobilize urban voters like Biden had.

2. **Berks (diverse, Latino growth)**: Barletta lost to Casey. McCormick won or nearly tied. The difference: Latino working-class voters (especially men) rejected Harris's campaign, seeing Republican economic messaging as more relevant than Democratic social progressivism.

3. **Beaver (working-class base)**: Barletta lost narrowly. McCormick won decisively. By 2024, the realignment was complete. Working-class steel country voters weren't hedging their bets anymore.

---

**The Bottom Line**: Barletta was 6 years too early. In 2018, working-class voters still saw Democratic candidates as their party. By 2024, the realignment was permanent enough that even a non-populist businessman (McCormick) could win working-class counties decisively. McCormick won because the working-class realignment was complete, not because he was a superior politician to Barletta—he was simply better positioned in 2024.


### Philadelphia Suburbs: The Realignment
Once Republican strongholds, Montgomery, Delaware, Chester, and Bucks counties have become Democratic-leaning:
- 2000: Competitive/lean Republican
- 2016: Clinton flipped multiple suburban House seats
- 2020-2024: Maintain Democratic margins, offsetting rural Republican gains

### Allegheny County (Pittsburgh): Western PA Anchor
Pittsburgh's transition from Republican steel city to Democratic metro:
- Delivers 100,000-150,000 Democratic margins
- Combined with Philadelphia, provides ~500,000 Democratic firewall
- Tech/healthcare economy attracting college-educated Democratic voters

### Southwest PA Rural Counties: Republican Surge
Counties like Beaver, Greene, Fayette, Washington, and Cambria show massive Republican gains:
- Former union/coal strongholds now voting 60%+ Republican
- Environmental concerns over fracking/'green' energy policies—intensified by the February 2023 East Palestine train derailment just across the Ohio border from Beaver County
- Manufacturing decline eroding Democratic base

### Why Pennsylvania Remains the Swing State
Unlike Ohio (now Safe Republican), Pennsylvania stays competitive because:
- Growing/stable metropolitan areas (Philly suburbs, Pittsburgh tech corridor)
- Multiple mid-sized cities (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Allentown)
- Increasing college-educated population in suburbs
- More diverse newcomer migration than Rust Belt decline states

## 🌊 Why Pennsylvania is America's Most Volatile Swing State

Pennsylvania stands alone among major swing states for its extreme volatility. Unlike Ohio (which stabilized Republican) or Florida (which trends toward one party), Pennsylvania swings dramatically cycle to cycle.

### The Volatility Numbers

#### Most Volatile Counties (Largest Single-Cycle Swings)

- **Schuylkill**: 31.20% max swing (7.80% avg)
- **Elk**: 28.20% max swing (11.40% avg)
- **Carbon**: 27.80% max swing (8.70% avg)
- **Wyoming**: 26.60% max swing (8.70% avg)
- **Luzerne**: 24.90% max swing (8.20% avg)
- **Northumberland**: 24.60% max swing (8.40% avg)
- **Forest**: 24.40% max swing (7.40% avg)
- **Lackawanna**: 24.00% max swing (9.70% avg)

## 🔄 The Swing State Mechanism: How Pennsylvania Swings

### Three Geographic Coalitions

Pennsylvania's volatility stems from three distinct geographic voting blocs that shift independently:

#### 1. **The Democratic Urban Firewall**
Democratic votes are concentrated in just a few counties:
- **Philadelphia** (1.6M residents): Delivers 400,000+ Democratic margin
- **Allegheny** (Pittsburgh, 1.2M): Delivers 100,000-150,000 Democratic margin
- **Total from 2 counties**: ~500,000 Democratic votes statewide

**Why volatile**: Margin expansion/contraction based on:
  - Turnout in younger, minority, college-educated voters
  - Swing margins upward (2020) or downward (2024) by 5-15%
  - Small percentage shifts create 50,000+ vote changes

#### 2. **The Suburban Battleground (Philadelphia Metro)**
Montgomery, Bucks, Delaware, Chester counties: ~1.5M residents
- Flipped Democratic 2016-2020, remain competitive 2024
- Shifted from Republican strongholds to Democratic-leaning
- Highly educated, professional, cross-pressured voters

**Why volatile**: 
  - Swing 15-20% between cycles
  - Highly responsive to economy, healthcare, social issues
  - College educated increasingly Democratic; non-college Republican

#### 3. **The Republican Exurban/Rural Avalanche**
Small towns, rural, exurban counties across 60+ counties
- Historically Republican but increasing polarization
- Working-class, manufacturing/coal economy
- Trump mobilized non-college voters 2016 onwards

**Why volatile**:
  - Shrinking population but expanding Republican margins
  - Running up 65-75% margins in strongholds
  - Turnout highly responsive to Trump/anti-establishment messaging

### The Math of Swing State Volatility

Republicans need:
- Win the rural avalanche at 60%+ margins ✓ (consistent 2016-2024)
- Limit Democratic margins in Philadelphia 25-35% margin
- Win suburban counties or come very close

Democrats need:
- Philadelphia 75%+ Democratic (consistent 2000-2024, margins growing)
- Allegheny 60%+ Democratic (consistent, occasionally challenged)
- Win suburbs at 3-5% margin minimum
- Come close in swing counties

**Result**: Margins shift based on:
1. Whether Philadelphia margins expand (2020: D+40%) or contract (2024: D+35%)
2. Whether suburbs go +3-5% Dem or stay flat
3. Whether rural areas reach 65%+ Republican or plateau at 60%

A 2-3% shift in any of these creates a 50,000+ vote swing statewide.

### Historical Volatility Timeline

- **2000 → 2004**: Margin +4.30% → +2.50% (-1.80% swing) (DEM)
- **2004 → 2008**: Margin +2.50% → +10.50% (+7.90% swing) (DEM)
- **2008 → 2012**: Margin +10.50% → +5.50% (-5.00% swing) (DEM)
- **2012 → 2016**: Margin +5.50% → -0.80% (-6.20% swing) (REP) **← FLIPPED!**
- **2016 → 2020**: Margin -0.80% → +1.20% (+1.90% swing) (DEM) **← FLIPPED!**
- **2020 → 2024**: Margin +1.20% → -1.70% (-2.90% swing) (REP) **← FLIPPED!**

## 📖 Reading the Results

### What does a county's color mean?
- **Red counties**: Republican advantage (Safe to Annihilation)
- **Blue counties**: Democratic advantage (Safe to Annihilation)
- **Gray counties**: Tossup or minimal margin (<0.50%)

### What indicates a county has "flipped"?
- Compare colors across two elections
- Look for dramatic margin changes (e.g., blue → red)
- Check vote share percentages for shifts

### Key Interpretations

**Pennsylvania Paradox**: Democrats consistently win Senate and gubernatorial races by substantial margins, yet presidential races remain razor-close. This reflects:
- Strength of Democratic urban coalition in local/state races
- Vulnerability to Republican gains in presidential turnout
- Importance of candidate-specific factors (e.g., Shapiro 56%, Harris 48%)

**The Math**: Democrats need:
- Philadelphia 400,000+ Democratic margin
- Allegheny 100,000-150,000 Democratic margin
- Philadelphia suburbs 100,000+ Democratic margin
- **Plus:** wins in swing counties (Dauphin, Centre, Lehigh, Northampton, Erie)

Republicans need:
- Win or come close in swing counties
- Run up 60%+ margins in rural/exurban Pennsylvania (84 counties)
- Limit Democratic margins in urban areas

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

Pennsylvania's 2024 result (Trump 50.50%, Harris 48.70%, R+1.80%) proves the state remains America's most crucial swing state—19 electoral votes decided by narrow margins. The interactive map reveals how this competitiveness emerges from a deeply divided geography: Democratic urban strongholds facing overwhelming Republican rural dominance, with suburban counties determining every election.
