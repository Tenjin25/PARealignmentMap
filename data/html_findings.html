<h5>🏛️ 2024 Senate Race: Dave McCormick Defeats Bob Casey Jr.</h5>
<p><strong>The End of an Era:</strong> In 2024, Republican Dave McCormick narrowly defeated three-term Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr., marking a stunning upset in Pennsylvania politics.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Casey Dynasty Ends:</strong> Bob Casey Jr. had served since 2007, winning three consecutive terms with comfortable margins (2006: D+17%, 2012: D+9%, 2018: D+13%)</li>
<li><strong>Working-Class Appeal Lost:</strong> Casey, from Scranton area, was known as a working-class Democrat who could win in rural Pennsylvania</li>
<li><strong>Trump Coattails:</strong> McCormick's victory mirrored Trump's ~2% win, showing Republican dominance extended down-ballot</li>
<li><strong>Realignment Confirmed:</strong> Even moderate, pro-union Democrats like Casey struggled in the new Pennsylvania electoral landscape</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The New Reality:</strong> Pennsylvania's working-class realignment wasn't just about presidential politics. The defeat of Bob Casey—a senator with deep Pennsylvania roots and working-class appeal—demonstrated that the Republican gains in coal, steel, and manufacturing regions represent a fundamental party realignment, not just candidate-specific preferences.</p>
